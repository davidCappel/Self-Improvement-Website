                    Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in America. 
                    Studies have found that up to roughly 10% of adults will experience some form of depression in their lifetime.
                    Depression comes in many shapes and forms depending on the person, which means that having a symptom doesn't mean you are depressed,
                    but on the other side of the coin, just because you don't have a specific symptom doesn't mean you're not depressed.
                    It's important to be able to identify symptoms of depression for your own health and others. 
                    Identifying potential signs of depression is the first step in both helping yourself and others who may be dealing with this illness.
                    Read the article below to learn more about potential symptoms of depression and to better identify them.

                    Despite the fact that depression is a mental illness, it can still cause negative physical effects to your body. 
                    Depdending on the person, sleeping schedule can drastically change. For some people, falling asleep and getting sleep at night becomes a challenge.
                    For others, constant drowsiness, or they always feel tired no matter what. Doctors agree that a consitent and good sleep schedule is extremely important for staying healthy.
                    Another symptom that is present in many cases is a drastic change in diet and eating habits. Again, this symptom is two sides of a coin, some turn to food for comfort, others eat hardly anything.
                    Either way, it creates a large swing in weight in short times which is very unhealthy for someone. Depression, like physical illnesses does have fatalities in the form of suicide.
