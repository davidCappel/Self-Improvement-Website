                    Newton's law of Attraction is a law that states that how you think influences your life's outcome. In basic terms, your thoughts mainfest your life. Bad thoughts = bad life outcomes, and Good thoughts = good life outcomes. Everything you want and everything you will ever have vibrates. Right now, you are vibrating on a frequency.The idea is that the better the emotion, the faster that it is vibrating.The highest frequencies are Love, Joy, Peace and Contemptment.  Raising your frequency is vibrating at those higher frequecies. The way that thought plays into this is becuause everything has matter. Thought has matter. What is matter controlled by. Gravity. Gravity pulls things closer. The density of your thoughts will pull things closer to you. You attract what you say and attract what you do.

                    Everyday is an opportunity to create a new life for ourselves. Often we stick to the same tired script, again and again, and call it routine, all the while complaining about what it is that we don't have yet, and thinking that that in and of itself is enough manifestation to change our reality. We have to wake up with the belif that we will succeeed. We have to go to bed with the prospect of a better tomorrow in mind. Not just so that it will just come to us, but also so that we can recognize opportunity when we see it and look for more. When you want something, you begin to look for it and then all of a sudden, it appears as if something just came to you. The truth is, you found it throgh unconcious manifestation and the Law of Attraction. Read this reflection of a spiritual Guru about how to end your day correctly with manifestation.
